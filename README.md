**KUBERNATES:**

Kubernetes (also called K8s) is an open-source platform for managing containerized applications. It helps you deploy, scale, and operate your applications automatically.
Think of it as the "orchestrator" that tells containers (like Docker containers) what to do, where to run, and how to stay healthy.

Why Do We Need Kubernetes?**
**
When you're working with many containers, managing them manually becomes hard. Kubernetes helps by:
Automatically starting and stopping containers.
Restarting containers if they crash.
Spreading containers across servers for load balancing.
Scaling up or down based on traffic.
Rolling out updates without downtime.

**Example Use Case (Simple Analogy)**

Imagine you own a food delivery business:
Containers = Delivery bikes.
Application = Food orders.
Kubernetes = Dispatcher who assigns, manages, and ensures deliveries are smooth.
You tell the dispatcher (Kubernetes): ‚ÄúI need 3 delivery bikes for Pizza App.‚Äù
Kubernetes (dispatcher) will:
Start 3 delivery bikes (containers).
Restart any bike if it crashes.
Add more bikes if there are too many orders.
Remove bikes if it‚Äôs late night and orders are low.


**Core Concepts of Kubernetes**
Component	What it Does
Pod	Smallest unit. Runs one or more containers together.
Node	A physical/virtual machine where pods run.
Cluster	Group of nodes managed by Kubernetes.
Deployment	Defines how many replicas of an app to run and how to update them.
Service	Provides a stable network endpoint for accessing pods.
Ingress	Routes external traffic (like from browsers) to services.
ConfigMap / Secret	Store configuration settings or sensitive data.

** How Does It Work?**
 
Basic Workflow:
You write a YAML file describing what app to run, how many instances (pods), and which image to use.
You run: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Kubernetes:
Schedules pods on available nodes.
Creates containers using Docker (or another runtime).
Sets up networking.
Monitors health.
Restarts crashed containers.
Exposes your app via a service.

**Feature	What Kubernetes Does:**

Orchestration	Manages containers automatically
Scaling	Add or remove pods based on demand
Self-Healing	Restarts failed pods
Rolling Updates	Zero-downtime deployment
Load Balancing	Distributes traffic to healthy pods
Declarative Configuration	Uses YAML files to describe desired state

üèóÔ∏è Kubernetes Architecture Overview

Kubernetes has a master-worker architecture:
Control Plane (Master Node): Manages the cluster.
Worker Nodes (Minions): Run the application containers inside Pods.

                          ‚Üï Communication via kube-apiserver


**1. Control Plane (Master Node)**
The brain of Kubernetes. It manages the cluster.

**kube-apiserver**: Entry point for commands. Exposes the Kubernetes API. All requests go through this.
**etcd:** A key-value store. Stores the cluster's state/configuration.
**kube-scheduler**: Decides which node to place a new Pod on.
**kube-controller-manager**: Ensures desired state (like checking if replicas are up, restarting failed pods).
**cloud-controller-manager**: Interacts with the cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) to manage load balancers, volumes, etc.

**2. Worker Nodes**
They actually run your application.

**kubelet:** Talks to the master. Ensures containers are running as expected on the node.
**kube-proxy:** Handles network routing and load balancing.
**Container Runtime:** Software that runs containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).
**Pods:** The smallest unit in Kubernetes. Each Pod holds one or more containers.

**3. Other Important Concepts**
Deployment: Defines how to run and manage replicas of an application.
Service: Provides a stable IP address and DNS name to access Pods.
Ingress: Exposes services externally (HTTP/HTTPS routes).
ConfigMap & Secret: Inject config values or sensitive data (like passwords) into containers.

API Primitives
These are the fundamental objects you interact with to manage your applications.
**Pods**: The smallest deployable unit. A Pod is a group of one or more containers that share storage and networking resources.
**ReplicaSets**: Ensures a specific number of Pod replicas are running at all times.
**Deployments**: Manages Pods and ReplicaSets, providing declarative updates and rollbacks for your applications.
**StatefulSets:** Manages stateful applications, ensuring stable network identities and persistent storage for each Pod.
**DaemonSets:** Ensures that a copy of a Pod runs on every selected node in the cluster.

Services & Other Network Primitives
These concepts manage communication within and outside the cluster.
Services: An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods. A Service provides a stable IP and DNS name, acting as a load balancer for the Pods.
**ClusterIP**: Exposes the Service on an internal IP, only accessible from within the cluster.
NodePort: Exposes the Service on a static port on each node's IP.
LoadBalancer: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
Ingress: Manages external access to services, typically HTTP/HTTPS traffic. It provides features like load balancing and SSL termination.
